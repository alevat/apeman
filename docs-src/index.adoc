APEMAN (short for Agile Project Estimation and Management) is envisioned as a set of integrated tools to track
all aspects of an Agile project, adding as little overhead as possible while capturing and tracking project
measurements to support estimation, project tracking and project controls.

For now, the software under development and associated content can be found
within the APEMAN GitHub project. In addition to the root of the project the
